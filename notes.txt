THEORY:
Block text elements, create a new line. Like <p></p>
##############
Inline elements can be inside other elements, like <em></em>
##############
Ctrl+U in Chrome for see the whole content.
###############
Navigation bar:
- In the address bar of the navigator, once we press on a nav link, it'll appear with a # and the section selected.
- If it appears with just a #, it means that is back to the nav menu.
##############
Link naming:
1. Avoid printing the full web address to the page.
2. Avoid "links to" phrase. We all know it is a link.
3. Keep your link text short. Exact topic. Not sentences.
4. No links that say "click here". It provides no meaning.
#############
Avoid sensitive information like personal emails or phone numbers.
##############
Link HOME site with href="/"
##############
Important to add an alt description in the images: if the image doesn't appear, the text will appear.
##############
"Below the fold" -> when there's content below what we can see and we need to scroll.
That's why is better to include in <img> elements: loading="lazy". It helps for the site performance.
###########
Good page layout:
· h1-h3
· navigation bar
· add section elements -> "article" is better:
    section is generic, article has a clear topic.
· header section & nav section
· body section & sections
· footer section
Try to avoid until you really understand why are needed:
· div -> divider elements
· span
Stick to semantic HTML rather than tables
###########
Tables don't take the whole width of the page.
###########
Forms: the input and the label elements should match the for and the id of both.
